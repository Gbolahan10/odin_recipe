            <h2>SUYA PASTA</h2>
            <img src="./recipes/suyapasta.webp" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
            <p> I had shared this simple Suya Pasta recipe on my instagram page almost three months ago and it was a hit! I think it was the simplicity of a lunch or dinner recipe that is ready in 20 minutes that made it a hit. It may also have been coming out of quarantine, we needed something delicious to take our minds of our realities. Personally, I make my suya at home but you can buy from a trusted, hygienic source. We are still dealing with the pandemic after all.</p>
            <p>Some questions a few people had were;</p>
            <p><em><strong> “Can I use any type of pasta?”</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong> My answer: Yes. From Spaghetti to Fusilli to Macaroni. I just chose to use Penne.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>“Can I use any type of meat for the same dish?”</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>My answer: Absolutely, if you do not have suya at home, use any protein you have and you can add some suya spice to the pasta sauce.</strong></em></p>

            <h2>CHOCOLATE YAM COOKIES</h2>
            <img src="./recipes/yamcookies.webp" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
            <p> African yams have so much diversity. One minute, they are chocolate yam cookies, the next minute, they are pounded yam. Whatever the case is, I find this delicious ingredient is a serious sleep inducer. It must be the high carbohydrate content that sends little sleep fairies to your eyes. As much as you try, you can never win the sleep battle with yam.</p>            <p>Some questions a few people had were;</p>
            <p><em>That little detail however was not present in this recipe. I wonder;</em></p>
            <p><em>“Is the format of consumption responsible for the sleep inducing factor?”</em></p>
            <p>If you are new to West African or Nigerian Cuisine, African yams are typically consumed in a few acceptable formats. These are; boiled yam, fried yam, pounded yam, roasted yam and occasionally a battered version called Yamarita. So far these other versions leave you feeling heavy and fulfilled which translates to sleep. However, when I baked these cookies, the reverse was the case.</p>
