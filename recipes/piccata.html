    <p>Note: Default quantity yields 4 servings</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ stick butter</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup white wine</li>
        <li>3 medium lemons, juiced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons drained capers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <p>Now that you are ready...</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Follow the cooking steps below:</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Slice chicken breasts horizontally to yield 4 pieces. Place breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound to 1/4-inch thin. Place flour on a plate and dredge each breast on both sides in flour.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Put chicken into the skillet and season tops with salt and pepper. Turn when nicely browned, about 4 minutes, and season again. Cook second side until browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer breasts to a plate, reserving skillet drippings.</li>
        <Li>Add wine and lemon juice to the skillet, stirring to scrape up any browned bits. Simmer to reduce and thicken sauce, about 5 minutes more. Add capers and pour sauce over chicken breasts on the plate. Sprinkle with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
